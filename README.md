### The Problem :

    We have a traffic intersection that regulates four different lanes
    
    Only certain signals can be green at a specific time and the rest 
    
    are red The signs must work in an orderly manner.

### Proposed Solution :

   - The two signals in lanes 1 can be green at the same time and the rest of the signals are red
   
   - The two signals in lanes 2 can be green at the same time and the rest of the signals are red
   
   - The signal in lane 3 can be green and the rest of the signals can be red
   
   - The signal in lane 4 can be green and the rest of the signals can be red

   >The signals must work according to the above order

   - Signals in Lane 5 allow cars to reverse lanes when this does not conflict with another signal
